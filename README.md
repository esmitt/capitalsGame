A simple game to guess the capitals of the world. Given a country name, appears 4 possible options, player have to select the proper one. Less time is better.

This mini-game is developed in Dart with Flutter using VSCode.

There is no optimization in the code, is just a week-end project :bulb:
Also, the idea came from this [_noCode_ game](https://fgz0i.glideapp.io/) developed previously using [Glide Apps](www.glideapps.com).
